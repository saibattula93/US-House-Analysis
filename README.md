## 5. Methodology
### 5.1. Problem Statement
The primary goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices in the US based on various features, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

### 5.2. Data
The project relies on a dataset of US house prices, which should be collected, cleaned, and preprocessed. This dataset should contain historical data on house sales, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and sale prices.

### 5.3. Techniques
The model will employ regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation will be essential steps in achieving accurate predictions.

## 6. Architecture
The architecture of the model will consist of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction. The selected machine learning algorithms will be integrated into the architecture to create a robust predictive model.

## 7. Pipeline
1. Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of US house prices from reliable sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features and select relevant features for model training.
4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression algorithms for training.
5. Model Training: Train and optimize the selected models using the preprocessed data.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
